# BowlingScoring
Bowling scoring screen simulator

Just open the index.html in the browser

Open tests.html to run the Unit tests.

The code consists of the following:

1. **game.js**: which encapsulates all the Bowling scoring logic inside the constructor function Game().
Game() has nothing to do with the views layer.

2. **game_view.js**: connects the bowling game logic with the views. It keeps references to some DOM elements, to update
them. For example (score views).
